# Error - Overview

## Basic

`Goframe` provides a powerful, rich, and unified error handling capability, implemented by the `gerror` component. This component is also the framework's unified error handling component. All components of the framework, if there is an error return, come with stack information, which makes developers easy to locate the problem.

## Usage

```go
import "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/errors/gerror"
```
