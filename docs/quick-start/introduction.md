# What is Goframe

Goframe is a modular, high-performance, enterprise-level Go development framework. It is a versatile foundational framework that serves as an enhanced extension of the Golang standard library, including a set of universal core development components. Goframe can be used for developing complete engineering projects, and due to its decoupled modular design, it can also be utilized as a toolkit.

If you are looking to develop a enterprise-level project or small project with Golang, Goframe is your best choice. If you aim to create a Golang component library, Goframe's ready-to-use, robust foundational component library can also greatly enhance your workflow and make your work more efficient.

Here is a minimal example of how to use Goframe:

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/frame/g"
)

func main() {

}

```
