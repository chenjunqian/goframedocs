# Component List - Overview

This section provides an overview of the core and community modules of the GoFrame framework.

## Core Modules

GoFrame provides a set of basic, commonly used modules that are simple, easy to use, and lightweight. These modules have minimal external dependencies and are carefully maintained by the main `gf` repository.

## Community Modules

Community modules are mainly contributed and maintained by the GoFrame community. Most of these modules are provided and maintained by contributors to the `gf` main repository. These modules are hosted under the `gogf` namespace and are at the same level as the main `gf` repository. Some community modules were separated from the main `gf` repository for independent maintenance. These modules are typically less frequently used or have heavier external dependencies.

> Currently, the documentation for community modules is not included. To learn how to use these community modules, please refer to the `README.md` file in each module's source code. Since many community modules are specific implementations of the core modules' interfaces, you can also refer to the associated core module documentation.
