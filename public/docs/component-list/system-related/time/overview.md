# Time - gtime

## Basic Introduction

The general time management module is designed to encapsulate commonly used time/date-related methods. It serves as a functional extension of Go's standard library `time`, offering more advanced features. This module supports custom date formatting syntax, which is inspired by PHP's `date` function syntax (<http://php.net/manual/zh/function.date.php>).

The time format syntax of `gtime` is very user-friendly for developers familiar with PHP.

## Usage

To use this module, import it as follows:

```go
import "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/os/gtime"
