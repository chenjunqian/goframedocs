# Goframe Documentation Translation Prompt

Please translate the following content or the Chinese technical documentation from the website link, ensuring the translation is comprehensive and includes all sections, paragraphs, and code comments. After translating, convert the document content into Markdown format to improve readability and facilitate future editing. The document is a technical guide about the Golang Web Framework Goframe. When translating, use simple and easy-to-understand English vocabulary to ensure it is accessible for overseas users. If the document is lengthy, please translate it in batches, and ensure each batch is complete and coherent.

Please note that the Markdown format should include, but is not limited to, the following elements:

- Headings and subheadings (use # to represent different levels of headings)
- Headings and subheadings should not contain these symbols: `, if it has, please remove these symbols
- Code blocks (use three backticks ``` and a language identifier)
- Lists (ordered or unordered)
- Links (use standard Markdown link format)
- Images (if the document contains images, ensure they are also converted to Markdown format)

During translation, if you encounter technical terms or specific concepts, consider adding brief explanations or footnotes to help readers better understand.

If you need further clarification or confirmation during the translation process, please feel free to communicate with me to ensure accuracy and consistency.

Please begin the translation work and provide the Markdown-formatted results for each section upon completion for my review.
