# API Documentation

## Basic Introduction

The GoFrame framework supports fully automated API documentation generation, ensuring that code and API documentation are maintained in sync. The automatically generated API documentation adheres to the standard OpenAPI v3 specification. Before diving into the OpenAPI v3 specification, it is recommended that you familiarize yourself with the framework's feature on standard routing: [Standard Router](/docs/web-development/router/registry/standard).
