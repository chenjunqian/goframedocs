## About Performance Testing

It should be noted that the `GoFrame` framework is a modular, low-coupling basic development framework, and the `HTTP Server` is just one of its core components.

Here, we only present the performance test report for the `HTTP Server`. The neutral third-party performance test report should be taken as the standard.
