# Routing - Routing Registration

## Basic Introduction

`WebServer` require methods and object support to provide services. The `ghttp` package supports a variety of routing registration modes, offering developers a very powerful and flexible interface functionality.

Routing registration is the core part of the entire `WebServer` and is also one of the most carefully designed modules in the `GoFrame` framework.

**Interface Documentation:** [ghttp package documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gogf/gf/v2/net/ghttp)

## Notes

Starting from `v2` of the framework, a `standardized routing` feature has been added, which is more suitable for business project engineering scenarios. It is recommended to use `standardized routing` in complex business projects: [Standardized Routing Registration](/public/docs/web-development/router/registry/standardized)
